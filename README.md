# Neural Machine Translation with Attention Model

## Overview

This project focuses on implementing a **Neural Machine Translation (NMT)** system using the **Attention Model**. The goal is to translate text from one language to another with high accuracy and contextual relevance.

## Motivation

Language translation is a crucial application of Artificial Intelligence, enabling effective communication across different languages. By leveraging advanced techniques like attention mechanisms, we can significantly enhance the quality of translations.

## Key Concepts

- **Neural Machine Translation (NMT)**: A type of artificial intelligence that uses neural networks to translate text.
- **Attention Mechanism**: Allows the model to focus on specific parts of the input sequence, improving translation accuracy.
- **Sequence Models**: Models that process sequential data, crucial for handling language translation tasks.
- **RNN (Recurrent Neural Network)**: A type of neural network designed for processing sequences of data.
- **LSTM (Long Short-Term Memory)**: A special kind of RNN capable of learning long-term dependencies, making it ideal for language tasks.

## Implementation

The project utilizes an attention-based sequence model that combines RNN and LSTM architectures. This approach captures the context of sentences effectively, allowing for better translations, especially with longer input sequences.
